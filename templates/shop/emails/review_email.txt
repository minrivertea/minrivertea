Hi {{ shopper.first_name }},

I hope you've had a chance to try your tea, and that you like it!

It's really important to me that you enjoyed your tea, and that everything went as you'd expect. If there's anything that you'd like to let us know, whether positive or negative, about the tea you bought, the order process or our website, please let us know:

{% for item in items %}
  {{ item.item.parent_product.name }} : http://www.minrivertea.com/review/{{ item.item.parent_product.slug }}/{{ shopper.id }}/
{% endfor %}

The link above will take you to a simple page on the Min River site where it will only take a minute to write down your thoughts. It will really help me improve the service, and helps others choose the right tea for them.

All the best

Chris West
