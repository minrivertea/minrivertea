Hi {{ shopper.first_name }},

I hope you've received your tea safe and sound! There's two things you might want to do now:

1. Visit the 'Learn' section of our website (http://www.minrivertea.com/learn/) if you want some tips about how to brew your tea. There's lots of pictures and information, and we're always adding more.

2. Post a review of your tea - it really helps us get feedback on what you did and didn't like about the tea, and helps other customers make better decisions too:

{% for item in order.items.all %}
    * Review your {{ item.item.parent_product }} - http://www.minrivertea.com{% url review_tea item.item.parent_product.slug %}
{% endfor %}

Thanks again, and enjoy your tea!

All the best
